This repo records my process of learning tensorflow and deep learning.

I mainly learn it by reading some classical books and papers, and then I try to implement some small projects.

Each folder contains a paper related to some subjects and an ipython notebook file, which implements the algorithm mentioned by the paper. 

**TODO**:

- GoogleNet
- ResNet
- AutoEncoders
- Convolutional AutoEncoders
- Neural Style Transfer
- GAN
